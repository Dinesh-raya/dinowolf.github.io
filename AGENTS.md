# Summary

## Goal
Clone imyai.in's look onto dinesh-raya.github.io + build free interactive SQL Project (50 problems, browser-based SQLite).

## Done
- Redesigned layout: imyai-inpired sticky header, hamburger menu, premium container, footer
- Homepage: hero + one "Cheatsheet" card + blog grid
- Consolidated CSS, removed dead code (admin, orphan posts, unused classes)
- Fixed 6 formula inaccuracies in cheatsheets
- Replaced Comic Sans logo with Inter SVG, added `--accent: #276EF1`
- Added live search to cheatsheet pages
- Built SQL Project: 7 tables, 50 YouTube Analytics problems, 30 categories
- SQL.js + CodeMirror, fully client-side, zero backend
- All 50 solution queries verified correct against SQLite
- Fixed 6 incorrect expected outputs
- Pushed to GitHub Pages

## Issues Fixed
- Solve page 404: Jekyll serves `/sql-project/solve` (no `.html`), but landing page linked to `/sql-project/solve.html` — fixed link

## Known Issues
- None

## Key Files
- `_layouts/default.html`: base layout
- `sql-project/index.html`: problem grid landing page
- `sql-project/solve.html`: interactive solve page
- `sql-project/problems.json`: 50 problems with schema, data, solutions
- `sql-project/assets/sql-editor.js`: SQL.js init, CodeMirror setup, query execution
- `sql-project/assets/sql-editor.css`: styling
- `_config.yml`: excludes `sql-project/generate.js` from Jekyll build
